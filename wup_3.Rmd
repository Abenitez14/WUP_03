```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
require(tidyverse)
require(tigerstats)
davisdata <- read.csv(file="UCDavis.csv")
```
## Our Goal is to answer this question Is there a difference between the alcohol consumed between the row
## you choose to sit in??
```{r eval=FALSE}
davisdata <- davisdata %>%
mutate(across(where(is.character), as.factor))
```
## Now with ggplot - first select the basic data

```{r}
basicCN <- ggplot(davisdata,aes(y=alcohol,x=Seat))
```
## Now add in boxplot

```{r}
basicCN + geom_boxplot()
```
  
There are a lot of differences in each of the medians such like the front is 0, middle is 2, and the back is 5.
